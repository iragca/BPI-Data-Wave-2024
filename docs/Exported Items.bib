	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2210.03629},
	abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

	abstract = {Business Intelligence (BI) helps organizations in making data-driven decisions by visualizing the current and historical data. Despite the plethora of BI tools, their accessibility and usability are still issues. To alleviate these issues, organizations use Chatbots. However, due to the variety of requirements and different organizational structures, developing a BI chatbot is a complex task that requires the collaboration of technical and BI experts. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for the automatic generation of personalized BI chatbots for organizations. The approach is implemented as a framework, which includes two components. First is a modeling component that allows the user to model the business-specific chatbot. Second is an automation component that automatically generates the chatbot code. We conducted a case study to evaluate the applicability of our approach. The results are promising for developing interactive BI chatbots according to various organizational needs.},

AI-driven systems process large datasets, identify patterns, and extract valuable insights. They automate data integration, cleansing, and transformation. Predictive analytics forecasts future trends, while natural language interfaces make data access easier. This paper gives an overview of the perspectives of intelligent empowerment of BI by AI. It focuses on presenting the ways AI can complement or even enhance the different processes of BI systems used for driving decision-making. Therefore, contextualizing the use of AI in business empowerment, we analyzed the perspectives of making intelligent empowerment of BI based on AI. We further exhibit a flowchart showing how AI Chatbots can assist BI processes to achieve the highest level of contextual autonomy and creative capability with continual improvement.},

Using a qualitative focus group discussion, this paper finds that social, technological, and economic factors play an important role with regards to MSME owners’ experience with business. Technological and social factors were cited as significant positive contributors, while economic factors were mentioned as negative contributors to MSME success.
